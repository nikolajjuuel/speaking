# React + TypeScript + Vite + Vercel

Working on an SVG animation, to potentially use for a contact form. Wanted the illusion of a thought being generated and shared with another person. Made some range sliders to interact with the SVG Stroke Dash Array and Stroke Dash Offset.

Created the SVG file using Adobe Illustrator and achieved the animation using requestAnimationFrame(). This makes the animation smooth.
