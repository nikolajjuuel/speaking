# React + TypeScript + Vite + Vercel

Working on an SVG animation, to potentially use for a contact form. Wanted the illusion of a thought being generated and shared with another person. Made some range sliders to interact with the SVG Stroke Dash Array and Stroke Dash Offset.

The SVG was made using Adobe Illustrator. The animation is achieved using requestAnimationFrame().
